     * BASE64. The image data is returned immediately without any trailing `<CR><LF>`

     * data will be returned. If the format is set to BASE64, the chunk will be BASE64

     * returned by the camera. Every chunk is returned with two bytes of junk at the
     * beginning and the total data returned is two bytes longer than requested to
     * account for it. This is **NOT** documented anywhere in the camera's manual.

     * request. You cannot re-request already sent chunks.
