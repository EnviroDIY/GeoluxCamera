## Geolux HydroCam

This uses the RS232 interface to communicate with and control the [Geolux HydroCam](https://www.geolux-radars.com/hydrocam).
The RS232 connection is on the green and yellow pins of the HydroCam.
An RS232-to-TTL adapter is needed between the HydroCam and an Arduino processor.

The camera requires a 9-27V DC power supply.
The specification state that the current consumption is 75 mA (Typical), 150 mA (Maximal).
I have not measured consumption to verify.
The camera boots very quickly after being powered on - generally a few hundred milliseconds or less.
After booting, the camera takes a few seconds to be ready to take a picture.
Changing the image settings can also take a few seconds.
Running autofocus takes almost 30s.

The camera supports multiple resolutions between 160x120 and 2592x1944 (5 Megapixel).
Larger images take longer to snap.
Images from the camera *must* be offloaded using RS232 at 115200 baud/8N1.
It takes almost a minute to transfer a 5mpx image from the camera to an SD card using a 120MHz SAMD51 processor with an SPI SD card.
Smaller images take much less time to transfer.

NOTE: The commands for changing Modbus, FTP, and ethernet connection parameters are **_not_** implemented in this library.
