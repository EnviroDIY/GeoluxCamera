The RS232 connection is on the green and yellow pins of the HydroCam. An RS232-to-TTL adapter is needed between the HydroCam and an Arduino processor.</p><p>The camera requires a 9-27V DC power supply. The specification state that the current consumption is 75 mA (Typical), 150 mA (Maximal). I have not measured consumption to verify. The camera boots very quickly after being powered on - generally a few hundred milliseconds or less. After booting, the camera takes a few seconds to be ready to take a picture. Changing the image settings can also take a few seconds. Running autofocus takes almost 30s.</p><p>The camera supports multiple resolutions between 160x120 and 2592x1944 (5 Megapixel). Larger images take longer to snap. Images from the camera <em>must</em> be offloaded using RS232 at 115200 baud/8N1. It takes almost a minute to transfer a 5mpx image from the camera to an SD card using a 120MHz SAMD51 processor with an SPI SD card. Smaller images take much less time to transfer.</p><p>NOTE: The commands for changing Modbus, FTP, and ethernet connection parameters are <strong><em>not</em></strong> implemented in this library.</p></section><section id=\"mainpage_contributing\"><h2>Contributing</h2><p>Open an <a href=\"https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/issues\">issue</a> to suggest and discuss potential changes/additions.</p></section><section id=\"mainpage_license\"><h2>License</h2><p>Software sketches and code are released under the BSD 3-Clause License &ndash; See <a href=\"https://github.com/EnviroDIY/GeoluxCamera/blob/master/LICENSE.md\">LICENSE.md</a> file for details.</p><p>Documentation is licensed as <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0</a> (CC-BY-SA) copyright.</p></section><section id=\"mainpage_acknowledgments\"><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p><a href=\"http://envirodiy.org/\">EnviroDIY</a>\u2122 is presented by the Stroud Water Research Center, with contributions from a community of enthusiasts sharing do-it-yourself ideas for environmental science and monitoring.</p><p><a href=\"https://github.com/SRGDamia1\">Sara Damiano</a> is the primary developer of the Geolux HydroCam library, with input from <a href=\"https://github.com/EnviroDIY/ModularSensors/graphs/contributors\">other contributors</a>.</p><p>This project has benefited from the support from the following funders:</p><ul><li>USGS Next Generation Water Observing System Rapid Deployment</li><li>Stroud Water Research Center endowment</li></ul></section>",
